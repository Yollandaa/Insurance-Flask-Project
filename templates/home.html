                    <h3>Comprehensive Car Cover</h3>
                    <p>
                        Comprehensive car cover provides the highest level of protection for your vehicle. 
                        It covers a wide range of risks, including theft, loss, damage from accidents, fire, vandalism, and natural disasters. With comprehensive cover, you can have peace of mind knowing that your car is fully protected against various unforeseen events.

                    <h3>Third-Party, Fire, and Theft Cover</h3>
                    <p>
                        Third-party, fire, and theft cover offers protection for your vehicle in case it's stolen or damaged by fire, while also providing coverage for any damage your vehicle causes to third parties. 
                        This type of cover is more affordable than comprehensive insurance and is ideal for budget-conscious individuals who want basic protection against theft and fire incidents.

                    <p>
                        Third-party only car cover provides coverage for damage caused by your vehicle to other people's property or vehicles. It does not cover any damage to your own vehicle. 
                        This type of cover is suitable for individuals who have older or lower-value cars and want to meet legal requirements without paying for comprehensive protection.
